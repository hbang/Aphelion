# 1.0b1
Very very very very beta build. Mostly just want feedback on whether authentication, timelines and links work. If the app crashes while loading or scrolling the timeline, please tell me the url to the tweet.

Known issues:
• Can't send tweets.
• Tapping cancel after tapping tweet crashes.
• iPad UI is probably really really broken.

# 1.0b2
• Completely reimplements OAuth support. Should fix some issues.
• Fixes crash when tapping Send, followed by Cancel.
• Fixes issues with the iPad UI.
• Fixes search tab glitches/crashes.
• Fixes TestFlight not sending back device UDID alongside crash logs.

Known issues:
• Messages, Profile, Search, Tweet Details are empty.
• Can't send tweets.
• Toolbar buttons above the tweet composer keyboard don't work.
• iPad: Sidebar buttons don't work.
• iPad: Tapping tweets/avatars makes it show in the same column instead of a new one.

I realised I suck at changelogs. (Thanks insanj.) Let's fix that.

• You wanted to send tweets? Well, you'll need to wait a bit longer. But we're getting closer! (aka, made the character counter actually count)
• Fixes those tweets that would cause a crash. Most of them, anyway. Also, I can't believe I didn't realise the solution for a month.
• Although it doesn't achieve much yet, tapping usernames and tweet URLs now opens it in-app.
• Ok, no bueno with the TestFlight UDID thing. Just going to use your device name instead.

Known issues:
• Not implemented yet: Messages, Profile, Search, Tweet Details.
• Account switcher doesn't live up to its name.
• Needs more awesome.

# 1.0b4
Bugs. Bugs everywhere.

• Fixes crashing tweets for real this time.
• Support pic.twitter.com links. (They're kinda weird.)
• Seeing your own avatar probably isn't all that important, but I fixed those bugs that ate your avatar (bugs do get hungry)
• Probably a good idea if I let you scroll in the tweet composer.

Known issues:
• Not implemented yet: Messages, Profile, Search, Tweet Details.
• Account switcher still doesn't live up to its name.
• Needs more awesome.
